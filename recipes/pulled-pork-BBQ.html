        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons dry barbeque rub, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 (3 1/2) pound bone-in pork shoulder blade roast</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon liquid smoke flavoring, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup water, divided</li>
            <li>¾ cup barbeque sauce, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>12 soft white hamburger buns</li>
            <li>¾ cup barbeque sauce, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 210 degrees F (100 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Sprinkle dry rub generously on all sides of pork roast and place meat into a heavy pan or Dutch oven.
            </li>
            <li>Pour 1/4 teaspoon of liquid smoke flavoring into each of two 6-ounce ramekins; fill ramekins with 1/2 cup water each. Place
                ramekins into the Dutch oven on either side of the roast. Place lid onto Dutch oven. 
            </li>
            <li>Roast pork in the preheated oven until very tender, 12 hours. Remove roast from Dutch oven, place onto a work surface (such as a cutting board), 
                and separate the meat from the bone using your fingers. Discard any large pieces of fat. 
            </li>
            <li>Roughly chop pork with a large knife or cleaver; drizzle with 3/4 cup barbeque sauce.
                Season with salt and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Spread about 1 tablespoon barbeque sauce onto each bun and pile pork
                on buns to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
